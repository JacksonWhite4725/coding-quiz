# Coding Quiz - DU Bootcamp Week 4 Homework

For this assignment, I was tasked with developing a coding quiz for basic JavaScript knowledge. The quiz has been designed to use a user's score as a metric for scoring. When the user begins the quiz, a countdown begins and continues until all questions are answered or the clock reaches 0 seconds. Afterwards, the user may submit and view their highscores on a seperate page.

To view the page, see the image below or click the following link:
